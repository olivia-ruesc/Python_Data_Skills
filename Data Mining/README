Data Mining: Web Scraping & Text Analysis of Georgia Tech Faculty
This project demonstrates a complete data mining workflow, starting from raw web data and ending with structured insights, visualizations, and sentiment analysis. It showcases practical skills in web scraping, text preprocessing, NLP, exploratory analysis, and visualization — all essential components of modern data science.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to collect and analyze biography text from faculty members in the Georgia Tech School of International Affairs. The workflow includes:

Scraping faculty profile pages using requests and BeautifulSoup

Extracting names, profile links, and biography text

Cleaning and preprocessing text for NLP tasks

Tokenizing sentences and words

Removing stopwords, punctuation, and noise

Building a term–document frequency matrix

Identifying word associations and common themes

Visualizing results with bar charts and word clouds

Performing sentiment analysis using VADER

This project highlights how unstructured text can be transformed into meaningful insights.

🧪 How the Code Works
1. Scraping
Faculty profile URLs are collected from the main directory page, then each profile is visited to extract:

Name

Biography text

Profile link

2. Text Preprocessing
The biography text is cleaned by:

Lowercasing

Removing punctuation

Removing stopwords

Removing numbers

Tokenizing into words and sentences

3. Analysis
The cleaned text is used to compute:

Word frequencies

Most common terms

Word associations

Sentiment scores

4. Visualization
The notebook includes:

Bar charts of top words

Word cloud of top 50 terms

Sentiment line plots

Sentence‑level sentiment bars

📊 Key Insights
Faculty biographies emphasize themes such as international relations, research, policy, global issues, and university engagement.

Sentiment is overwhelmingly neutral or positive, reflecting professional academic tone.

Word associations reveal clusters around research areas and institutional affiliations.

🚀 Why This Project Matters
This project demonstrates the ability to:

Work with real‑world, messy, unstructured data

Build a reproducible data mining pipeline

Apply NLP techniques to extract insights

Communicate results visually and clearly

It’s a strong example of end‑to‑end data science work suitable for a professional portfolio.

📎 Future Improvements
Potential next steps include:

Topic modeling (LDA)

Named entity recognition

Clustering faculty by research themes

Deploying results as an interactive dashboard
