# Python Data Skills

This repository showcases a collection of Python-based data analysis exercises designed to demonstrate my technical skills in data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and workflow documentation. These projects are educational and skill-focused, using datasets provided through coursework at Western Illinois University.

Because these datasets are simulated or classroom-generated, the goal of each project is to highlight Python proficiency, not to draw real-world conclusions. Each folder contains the Python script or notebook used for analysis, along with the associated dataset.

For formally written analyses using publicly available, real-world data, please see my **Research Projects** repository. That collection includes full reports, presentations, and academic-style analysis created using Python or R.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository demonstrates my ability to:
- Work with diverse data types (CSV, XML, geojson, scraped text)  
- Build reproducible analysis workflows in Jupyter  
- Apply Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, contextily, and BeautifulSoup  
- Communicate results clearly through Markdown and structured notebooks  
- Showcase technical skills without drawing real-world conclusions from classroom datasets  

It complements my **Research Projects** repository by focusing on *technical proficiency* rather than academic modeling.

## Tools & Technologies

Across the projects, I use:
- **Python** (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, contextily, BeautifulSoup, xml.etree, etc.)  
- **Jupyter Notebooks** for reproducible workflows  
- **Markdown** for documentation and explanation  
- **GeoJSON & XML** handling for specialized data formats
