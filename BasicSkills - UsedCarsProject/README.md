# Used Cars Analysis

## Overview

This project explores a used car dataset using Python-based exploratory data analysis techniques. The goal is to understand trends in vehicle pricing, mileage, manufacturing year, and make thorough descriptive statistics, visualizations, and grouped summaries.
The analysis focuses on identifying common patterns in the used car market and gaining insight into how key variables relate to one another.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was provided as part of a university course. While the original public source was not specified, the data represents a real-world used car listings dataset withint the United States containing information such as:
- Vehicle make
- Model year
- Price
- Mileage

Basic data cleaning steps were applied, including handling missing values and skipping malformed rows during import.

## Tools & Libraries

This project was completed using:
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Analysis Workflow

The notebook follows a structured exploratory data analysis process:
- Data Import & Cleaning
- Reading the dataset with pandas
- Handling missing and invalid entries
- Descriptive Statistics
- Summary statistics for numerical variables
- Identification of center and spread
- Univariate Visualizations

The project includes multiple plots to help interpret the data.

These visualizations support pattern recognition and trend analysis across the dataset.
