# Python Data Skills

This repository showcases a collection of Python-based data analysis exercises designed to demonstrate my technical skills in data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and workflow documentation. These projects are **educational and skill-focused**, using datasets provided through coursework at Western Illinois University.

Because these datasets are simulated or classroom-generated, the goal of each project is to highlight **Python proficiency**, not to draw real-world conclusions. Each folder contains the Python script or notebook used for analysis, along with the associated dataset.

For formally written analyses using publicly available, real-world data, please see my **Research Projects** repository. That collection includes full reports, presentations, and academic style analysis created using Python or R.
